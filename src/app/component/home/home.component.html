  <h2>Environmental Program Set Up 123</h2>

  <p>
    Programs for managing environmental requirements and compliance must be defined at the location level.
    <br>
    To begin, select a location and then those regulatory areas that apply. In the following steps, this wizard will
    walk you through each set of requirements.
    Creating your program will require the input of dates and historical activities, so it may take a little time.
    You will be able to stop and save throughout the setup.
    Once complete, the Safety Management Suite will help you manage your program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once your first location is complete, you will be able to copy your program from location to location and edit each
    to save time.
